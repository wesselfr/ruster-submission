# Ruster Submission template

This is meant as a repository where to store your code and your submission.  

🧑‍💻 For the codebase feel free to just store it in the root folder.

📜 For the submission I prepared a file `docs/index.md` which provides some instructions of how to fill it.

> Ideally make this repository public and enable GitHub pages in `Settings/Pages` and set deploy from `Main` branch and `/docs` folder.
> Provide either the link to this repository or the github page in the submission form.
